Sketch graphically the problem 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{x_1,x_2} & \quad f({\bf x})=(x_1+1)^2+(x_2-2)^2\\
{\text{subject to }} & \quad g_1 = x_1-2\leq 0,{\quad} g_3 = -x_1\leq 0,\\
& \quad g_2 = x_2-1\leq 0, {\quad} g_4 = -x_2\leq 0.
\end{aligned}
$$

Find the optimum graphically. Determine directions of feasible descent at the corner points of the feasible domain. Show the gradient directions of $f$ and $g_i$s at these points. Verify graphical results analytically using the KKT conditions.
