    "## Application of Reduced Gradient - Topology Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"tutorial_topopt/infill.gif\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"height: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will learn to implement an optimization algorithm for \n",
    "minimizing the compliance of a structure at its equilibrium state with respect to\n",
    "its topology. The tutorial is based on Dr. Sigmund's topology optimization \n",
    "[code](http://www.topopt.dtu.dk/?q=node/751) \n",
    "and [paper](http://www.topopt.dtu.dk/files/TopOpt88.pdf). The template code is attached at the end of the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The compliance minimization problem\n",
    "Topology optimization has been commonly used to design structures and materials with optimal mechanical, \n",
    "thermal, electromagnetic, acoustical, or other properties. \n",
    "The structure under design is segmented into $n$ finite elements, and a \n",
    "density value $x_i$ is assigned to each element $i \\in \\{1,2,...,n\\}$: A higher density corresponds to a less porous material \n",
    "element and higher Yong's modulus. Reducing the density to zero is equivalent to creating a hole in the \n",
    "structure. Thus, the set of densities ${\\bf x}=\\{x_i\\}$ can be used to represent the topology of the \n",
    "structure and is considered as the variables to be optimized. A common topology optimization problem is \n",
    "compliance minimization, where we seek the \"stiffest\" structure within a certain volume limit to withhold \n",
    "a particular load: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min_{\\bf x} \\quad {\\bf f} := {\\bf d}^T {\\bf K}({\\bf x}) {\\bf d} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{subject to:} \\quad {\\bf h} := {\\bf K}({\\bf x}) {\\bf d} = {\\bf u}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\quad {\\bf g} := V(\\textbf{x}) \\leq v,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\textbf{x} \\in [0,1]. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $V(\\textbf{x})$ is the total volume; $v$ is an upper bound on volume; \n",
    "${\\bf d} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_d\\times 1}$ is the displacement of the structure under the load ${\\bf u}$, \n",
    "where $n_d$ is the degrees of freedom (DOF) of the system (i.e., the number of x- and y-coordinates \n",
    "of nodes from the finite element model of the structure);\n",
    "${\\bf K(x)}$ is the global stiffness matrix for the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\bf K(x)}$ is indirectly influenced by the topology ${\\bf x}$, through the element-wise stiffness matrix \n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\bf K}_i = \\bar{\\bf K}_e E(x_i),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the local-to-global assembly: \n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\bf K(x)} = {\\bf G}[{\\bf K}_1,{\\bf K}_2,...,{\\bf K}_n],$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the matrix $\\bar{\\bf K}_e$ is predefined according to the finite element type (we use first-order \n",
    "quadrilateral elements throughout this tutorial) and the nodal displacements of the element (we use \n",
    "square elements with unit lengths throughout this tutorial), ${\\bf G}$ is an assembly matrix, $E(x_i)$ is \n",
    "the element-wise Young's modulus defined as a function of the density $x_i$: \n",
    "$E(x_i) := \\Delta E x_i^p + E_{\\text{min}}$, where $p$ (the penalty parameter) is usually set to 3.\n",
    " This cubic relationship between the topology and the modulus \n",
    "is determined by the material constitutive models, and numerically, it \n",
    "also helps binarize the topologies, i.e., to push the optimal ${\\bf x}_i$ to 1 or 0 (why?). \n",
    "The term $E_{\\text{min}}$ is added to provide numerical stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design sensitivity analysis\n",
    "This problem has both inequality and equality constraints. However, the inequality ones are only related\n",
    "to the topology $\\textbf{x}$, and are either \n",
    "linear ($V(\\textbf{x}) \\leq v$) or simple bounds ($\\textbf{x} \\in [0,1]$). We will \n",
    "show that these constraints can be easily handled.\n",
    "The problem thus involves two sets of variables: We can consider $\\textbf{x}$ as the **decision variables** \n",
    "and $\\textbf{u}$ as the state variables that are governed by $\\textbf{x}$ through the equality constraint\n",
    "${\\bf K}({\\bf x}) {\\bf d} = {\\bf u}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reduced gradient (often called design sensitivity) can be calculated as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{df}{d{\\bf x}} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial {\\bf x}} - \n",
    "\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial {\\bf u}}(\\frac{\\partial {\\bf h}}{\\partial {\\bf u}})^{-1}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial {\\bf h}}{\\partial {\\bf x}},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which leads to \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{df}{d{\\bf x}} = -{\\bf u}^T \\frac{\\partial {\\bf K}}{\\partial {\\bf x}}{\\bf u}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the relation between ${\\bf K}$ and ${\\bf x}$, and notice that \n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\bf u}^T {\\bf K}{\\bf u} = \\sum_{i=1}^n {\\bf u}^T_i{\\bf K}_i{\\bf u}_i,$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "i.e., the total compliance (strain energy) is the summation of element-wise compliance. \n",
    "We can further simplify the gradient as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$-{\\bf u}^T \\frac{\\partial {\\bf K}}{\\partial {\\bf x}}{\\bf u} = - \\frac{\\partial {\\bf u}^T{\\bf K}{\\bf u}}{\\partial {\\bf x}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = - \\frac{\\partial \\sum_{i=1}^n {\\bf u}^T_i{\\bf K}_i{\\bf u}_i}{\\partial {\\bf x}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = [..., - \\frac{\\partial {\\bf u}^T_i{\\bf K}_i{\\bf u}_i}{\\partial x_i}, ...] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = [..., - {\\bf u}^T_i \\frac{\\partial {\\bf K}_i}{\\partial x_i}{\\bf u}_i, ...]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = [..., - {\\bf u}^T_i \\frac{\\partial \\bar{\\bf K}_e \\Delta E x_i^3}{\\partial x_i}{\\bf u}_i, ...]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = [..., - 3\\Delta E x_i^2 {\\bf u}^T_i \\bar{\\bf K}_e {\\bf u}_i, ...]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The algorithm\n",
    "The pseudo code for compliance minimization is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Problem setup (see details below)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Algorithm setup: $\\epsilon = 0.001$ (or any small positive number), $k = 0$ (counter for the iteration),\n",

    "    3.1. Update the stiffness matrix ${\\bf K}$ and the displacement (state) ${\\bf u}$ (finite element analysis)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.2. Calculate element-wise compliance ${\\bf u}^T_i \\bar{\\bf K}_e {\\bf u}_i$\n",

    "    where $\\mu \\geq 0$ is determined as in 3.7. To ensure that the gradient descent is successful, we will either set\n",
    "    $\\alpha_k$ to a small value, or truncate $\\Delta x = - (\\frac{df}{d{\\bf x}} + \\mu {\\bf 1})$ within a range \n",
    "    (conceptually similar to the idea of trust region).\n",
    "         \n",
    "    3.7. Move ${\\bf x}'_{k+1}$ back to the feasible domain:\n",
    "    If ${\\bf 1}^T{\\bf x}_{k} < v$ and $-{\\bf 1}^T\\frac{df}{d{\\bf x}}<0$, then ${\\bf x}'_{k+1}$ satisfies $g$.\n",
    "     with $\\mu = 0$. If ${\\bf x}'_{k+1}$ does not satisfy $g$, we will increase $\\mu$ using bisection, i.e.,\n",
    "     search in $[0,\\mu_{max}]$ where $\\mu_{max}$ is a large positive number. Also, we \n",
    "     will truncate ${\\bf x}'_{k+1}$ between 0 and 1. \n",

    "    3.8. Update $norm(\\Delta x)$, $k = k+1$\n",

    "### Implementation details\n",
    "Some details of the template code is explained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The numbering rule for elements and nodes\n",
    "The template code assumes a rectangular design domain, where each element is modeled as a unit square. \n",
    "The numbering of elements and nodes are explained in the figure below.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input parameters\n",
    "Inputs to the program are (1) the number of elements in the x and y directions (```nelx``` and ```nely```), \n",
    "(2) the volume fraction (```volfrac```, this is the number between 0 and 1 that specifies the\n",
    "ratio between the volume of the target topology and the maximum volume $nelx \\times nely$), (3) the penalty\n",
    "parameter of the Young's Modulus model (```penal```, usually **=3**), and (4) the filter radius (```rmin```, \n",
    "usually **=3**).\n",
